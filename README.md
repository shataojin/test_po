NOTE FOR ME

todo:
Add a T/F to all buttons, and then create a c# to read the T/F of all button files. If a button is T, if the button is pressed again with the left button, get the coordinates of the block and create a block at this position. If the right button is pressed, the debug log displays the test

In theory, a c# should be created to control the creation of new tanks and the removal of landmarks. Add the T/F trigger to the own button c# and add it to the control file to make changes.
