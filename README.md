NOTE FOR ME

todo:
Add a T/F to all buttons, and then create a c# to read the T/F of all button files. If a button is T, if the button is pressed again with the left button, get the coordinates of the block and create a block at this position. If the right button is pressed, the debug log displays the test

In theory, a c# should be created to control the creation of new tanks and the removal of landmarks. Add the T/F trigger to the own button c# and add it to the control file to make changes.

After completion, theoretically, the game operation has been completed. Test it. If it runs, add a counter. When the counter reaches a certain value, allow the button to be pressed, and then reduce the corresponding value. If the tank is placed, determine which button is still active based on the current value. It is allowed to be pressed. If the player chooses to withdraw, the value is added back. (The value is a set limit ) which button is still allowed to be pressed based on the current value. Carry out the test, and conduct a complete test after completion. When the base hp is less than 0, pause the game and show the debug log game over.
